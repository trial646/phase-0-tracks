# Git Definitions1

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control manages changes accross multiple users and or at different times. It helps consolidate changes while reducing confusion over what the working version looks like. It also lets you go back to an earlier version of the file
* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch creates a separate work space for your particular changes and credits those changes to you. While you work here the master does not change so you can play around and change your mind about things without it confusing others working on the same project and without altering the master before you are ready. It keeps the master clean.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is when you are ready to incorporate your work into the master and you are finalizing changes to be incorporated into the master. Good commit message is specific enough about what changes you made on the branch so if there needs to be a correction later you can isolate the source of the problem easily.
* What is a merge conflict? When changes two different sets of changes to the same piece of code contradict each other in some way that can not be automatically reconciled.
