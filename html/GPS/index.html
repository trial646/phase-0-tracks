The purpose of html5 semantic tags: is to give structure to the page, organizing what the user is seeing and making the outline of the page flow well. I found aside to be helpful - as a way to break up big blocks of text and to communicate ideas that are different from the main page (but related) without having to navigate away from the page.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? Unsure how to answer this even after research. I beleive browswer renders html first, then css but that is not what is being asked...
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? I learned about the different character sets (charset) and how that determines the range of characters that can can be used including imojis, non-english languages, etc. I also learned how to make a custom snippet for a peice of code that I expect to use over and over again. I will likely explore what snippets already exist then build my own as needed.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? The second question in this reflection - about the order the browser uses to display elements.
